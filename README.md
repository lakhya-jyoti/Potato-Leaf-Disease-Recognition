# Potato Leaf Disease Recognition System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Potato Leaf Disease Recognition System**! This system helps in identifying potato plant diseases quickly and accurately. By simply uploading or capturing an image of a potato leaf, our system automatically detects potential diseases, offering instant results with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Upload or Capture Image** – You can either upload an image or capture a live photo of the potato leaf.
- **Disease Detection** – The system processes the image using a deep learning model to identify the disease.
- **Instant Results** – Receive immediate predictions on the condition of the potato plant.

### Supported Diseases

- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Healthy**

## How it Works

1. **Upload Image** – Upload an image of the potato leaf for analysis.
2. **Analysis** – The system processes the image and predicts the disease using a trained machine learning model.
3. **Result** – Instantly get the disease name based on the uploaded or captured image.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** – For building and utilizing the pre-trained model.
- **Streamlit** – To build the interactive web interface.
- **PIL** – To handle image processing tasks such as resizing.
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations and image array manipulation.
- **OpenCv** - For image handling.
